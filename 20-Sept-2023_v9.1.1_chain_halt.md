# Chain Halt 20-09-2023 Postmortem

## Summary

**Date of Incident:** Wednesday 20th September 2023, 14:32 UTC (Block [#13263217](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/blocks/13263217))

**Authors:** Puneet, Maksim, Jeroen

**Status:** Resolved

**Summary:** The chain halted 16 days after the PersistenceCore v8 Pacaya Upgrade due to a bug identified in the Liquid Staking Module fork that went live on the Persistence Core1 chain.

**Impact:**

- Downtime for ~19 hours and 33 minutes.
- All transactions for Pstake and Dexter were non-functional during the downtime.

**Root Cause:** In order to use the LSM, validators were instructed to create a new account with which they could stake some tokens and consequently validator-bond. Normally, similar to with normal delegations, any change in validator-bonds should update the `delegator_shares` information for a validator. However, due to a bug in the code, in certain edge cases, this `delegator_shares` information wasn't updated correctly in the validator-struct for accounts from which the validator-bond was initiated, causing a mismatch in the shares counted in the validator struct vs the shares actually owned by all delegators.

**Trigger:** The trigger for the chain halt was a faulty transaction from a delegator who had no validator bond and was doing a normal delegation to a validator with the aforementioned discrepancy in its delegator-shares field.

**Detection:** This issue was identified on the testnet test-core-2 chain on Tuesday 19/09. While we were in the process of preparing a fix & patch for the testnet & mainnet, the problem occurred on mainnet too, causing the chain to halt at Block height [13,263,217](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/blocks/13263217).

**Resolution:** Restart the chain by requesting all validators to replace their old binaries with new binaries including the fix, the state migration code that amends created discrepancies, as well as the previously approved upgrade (from Proposal #44) which was scheduled to happen on Thursday 21/09 regardless.

## Lessons Learned

What Went Well:

- Easy communication channels with validators on Discord & Telegram.
- Team was quickly able to get to the root cause of the issue
- Divided the work well between our team members

What Went Wrong:

- IBC Clients expired on testnet
- Not all Validators were active to update the binary and restart the node. This caused a significant delay in the chain upgrade. 
- Ideally this bug should have been found on testnet before it even came to mainnet. This particular test case was missed, but has been added now.

Where We Got Lucky:

- The cause and trigger of the issue happened in close proximity, so debugging was easier. 

## Detailed Timeline

**19th September 2023:**

13:50 GST: Sergey.Mitk from Stakeflow flagged an issue indicating that the testnet chain had come to a halt at block height [1728610](https://testnet.mintscan.io/persistence-testnet/blocks/id/1728610). This triggered immediate debugging actions from the team.

14:00 GST: The team initiated an in-depth investigation to determine the root cause of the testnet chain's halt.

**20th September 2023:**

16:30 GST: The team successfully identified the [root cause](https://github.com/persistenceOne/cosmos-sdk/compare/v0.47.3-lsm3...v0.47.3-lsm5#diff-fb1fb56df25f422dcd246c4517169542f2a04e040d8e39d261ee8ee1477bee46R180) of the testnet issue and quickly realized that this problem could also occur on the Mainnet.

18:00 GST: The team reached a consensus on the approach to resolve the identified issue. A fix was planned for the next chain upgrade, scheduled for the following day at Mainnet chain height 13,275,500.

18:32 GST: As the team was in the process of preparing the patch, the anticipated issue surfaced on the Mainnet, causing the chain to halt at Block height 13263217.

19:00 GST: The team started working on the preparation of a patch compatible with the Cosmos SDK.

20:00 GST: Work commenced on drafting [fork instructions](https://github.com/persistenceOne/persistenceCore/blob/v9.2.1/app/upgrades/v9.2.0/upgrades.go#L24) for the Persistence chain.

23:00 GST: The team conducted tests on the fork instructions, initially on the testnet and subsequently on the Mainnet.

23:52 GST: An announcement was made to all validators that the upgrade would be postponed until the following day. This decision was based on the team's ongoing testing in the readiness of the bug fix.

**21st September 2023:**

01:00 GST: The team began local reproduction of the issue to validate the error by writing integration tests. This was to ensure that the patch was functioning as intended.

10:15 GST: A new release was rolled out to restart the test-core-2. The team awaited manual replacement of the binaries by the testnet validators to reach consensus and the subsequent node restart.

Release/Tag: [PersistenceCore v9.2.1](https://github.com/persistenceOne/persistenceCore/releases/tag/v9.2.1)

11:15 GST: Consensus was reached, and the testnet core-2 chain was successfully restarted. After confirming all functionalities, plans were made to proceed with the Mainnet upgrade.

11:35 GST: A new release was issued to restart the core-1 chain. The team awaited manual replacement of the binaries by the Mainnet validators to reach consensus and the subsequent node restart.

Release/Tag: [PersistenceCore v9.2.1](https://github.com/persistenceOne/persistenceCore/releases/tag/v9.2.1)

14:07 GST: Consensus was reached, and the Core-1 chain was successfully restarted.

14:15 GST: The team began testing all functionalities on the Mainnet to ensure that everything was working as expected.

15:30 GST: The team concluded testing and confirmed that everything was working as expected and that the bug had been resolved. The team also conducted tests to support ledger integration on pStake for liquid staking of $ATOM, in accordance with the previously approved upgrade from [Proposal #44](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/proposals/44), which was originally scheduled for September 21st.
